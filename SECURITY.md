# Yoma Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Bug

If you think you have discovered a security issue in any of the Yoma projects, we'd love to
hear from you. We will take all security bugs seriously and if confirmed upon investigation we will
patch it within a reasonable amount of time and release a public security announcement discussing the
bug and credit the discoverer.

Security bugs can be reported via email. The process is as follows:

(email) Subject: Security Issue: [repo-name] - [Type of bug]

(email) Content: Description of the bug + how to reproduce the bug

Email Yoma at: [tech at yoma dot world](mailto:tech@yoma.world).

*Note. It is not necessary to include the type of bug if you are not sure how to classify it.*
*A detailed description will be adequate.*
